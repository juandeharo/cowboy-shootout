To play the game you have to press start which will bring you to the main game screen. The way the game is played is you have three options: shield, shoot, and load. Before you can shoot you need to have loaded a bullet. When you click a choice the computer makes a random choice as well following the same rules. You can also choose to mute the game. After you win or lose a screen comes up asking if you want to continue or go back to the home screen.
